    "summary": "UiPath Inc. (PATH) is a leading AI automation software company that has recently experienced fluctuations in its stock price. While earnings estimates are rising, the stock has declined significantly in the past year.

Additionally, the company is offering free agentic AI certification to help laid-off government workers secure tech jobs. Overall, while the stock has been volatile, it may be worth considering for those looking for AI stocks under $50 to buy now.",
